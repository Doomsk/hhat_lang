      - [x] `sequential` expression scope
      - [x] `concurrent` expression scope
      - [x] `parallel` expression scope
  - [ ] function scope
    - [ ] write down its syntax
  - [ ] alternative quantum variable scope
    - [ ] function-like syntax
  - [ ] import scope
    - [ ] decide how it will look like 
    - [ ] import syntax
- [ ] semantics
  - [ ] transform AST as R (just call it R for now) to accommodate more data relative to its execution by the Evaluator
    - [ ] function calls
      - [ ] function only
        - [x] built-in's
        - [ ] user-defined
      - [x] with args
    - [ ] variables
    - [x] literals
    - [ ] quantum data
      - [ ] reads R backwards until reaches the beginning of its expression
      - [ ] holds R data structure to be executed at the right moment
  - [ ] main
    - [ ] checking expressions
      - [ ] transform into a data
    - [ ] checking scopes
      - [ ] concurrent & parallel scopes
        - [ ] _a posteriori_ variable calls wait until variable is unlocked from usage on current expression
      - [ ] variable
        - [ ] lasts until scope ends unless below
        - [ ] lives to upper scope if it is the last 'operation' in the expression
  - [ ] functions
    - [ ] store function into memory to be accessible as R data structure
    - [ ] args in order and types as keys to access correct function content (function will support overloading -- most probably)
  - [ ] imports
    - [ ] get the R data structure from imported functions
    - [ ] store functions in memory
 

## Functionality

- [x] basics
  - [x] data as arrays
  - [x] built-in functions
  - [x] variables are immutable
- [ ] scope
  - [x] scopes create array of data
  - [ ] sequential scopes produce sequential code execution
  - [ ] concurrent scopes produce concurrent code execution
  - [ ] parallel scopes produce parallel code execution
  - [ ] execute variable-dependent expression according to variable's unlocking time
  - [ ] data lives only inside scope
    - [ ] unless the last data that will be passed to the next expression
    - [ ] unless the last data is a variable that will live on the upper scope lifetime
- [ ] quantum helm
  - [ ] quantum data
    - [ ] quantum data as an R data structure holder for later execution... thing
