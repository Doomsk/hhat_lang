# H-hat Language Interpreter Super-Module

Here lies a basic dialect language of $\hat{H}$. It should be seeing as a feature- and implementation- wise testing dialect rather than a definitive and monolithic one. Its main purpose lies on showing concrete examples of the language features, capabilities, paradigms and approaches. Concrete and visual examples always work better than theory and slides[^1]. In further versions, it may sit as its own repository (and thus its own PYPI package), if needed.

Its name of choice is _H-hat heather_ dialect. It is not called _vanilla_, but rather [_heather_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calluna)[^2].
