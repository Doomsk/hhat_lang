# H-hat Language Core Index Module

This module defines the structure and behavior of the indexes in $\hat{H}$ language.

## What are _indexes_ ?

<mark>Indexes are **qubits** labelled differently to avoid unnecessary complexity and
    ambiguity for the user to build programs.</mark>

The goal of $\hat{H}$ language is to close the gap between software development and quantum resources. For this reason, it was a design decision to avoid using naming conventions that are quantum physics (or quantum mechanics, quantum information theory) specific, and try bringing more meaningful, computer science theory-oriented naming conventions. Since the field of quantum computer science is not well established, it also is an attempt to raise awareness of such initiatives and push them to happen eventually.
