# H-hat Language Module on Quantum Backends

Here lies all the available (or to be implemented) quantum backends. They define the connections to the actual backends through [quantum low level languages](../quantum_lowlevel_languages/README.md#h-hat-language-quantum-low-level-language-backend). Not all quantum low level languages can access all quantum backends.
