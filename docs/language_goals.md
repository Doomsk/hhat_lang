# Language Goals

## First Step

- produce a MVP/POC with Python to show the ideas behind the language on the items below
	- have the complete syntax
		- lexer
		- parser
		- ast
		- error messages, stuff you know
	- unittesting
	- documentation
	- define possible outputs
	- finish the basic structures
	- implement circuit, measurement, hashmap types
	- write the built-in functions (input, output, gates, etc)
		- files IO
			- txt
			- qasm files\*?
			- json\*\*
		- user IO (whatever it means)
	- define and implement built-in algorithms
		- qsearch, for instance


## Second Step

- produce the actual language in a serious programming language, such as rust, c, c++, lisp(?)
